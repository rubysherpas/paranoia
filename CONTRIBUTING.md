Paranoia is an open source project and we encourage contributions.

## Filing an issue

When filing an issue on the Paranoia project, please provide these details:

* A comprehensive list of steps to reproduce the issue.
* What you're *expecting* to happen compared with what's *actually* happening.
* Your application's complete `Gemfile.lock`, and `Gemfile.lock` as text in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) (*not as an image*)
* Any relevant stack traces ("Full trace" preferred)

In 99% of cases, this information is enough to determine the cause and solution
to the problem that is being described.

Please remember to format code using triple backticks (\`) so that it is neatly
formatted when the issue is posted.

## Pull requests

We gladly accept pull requests to add documentation, fix bugs and, in some circumstances,
add new features to Paranoia.

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
to know that you have a clean slate.

3. Create new branch then make changes and add tests for your changes. Only
refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding
functionality or fixing a bug, we need tests!

4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
